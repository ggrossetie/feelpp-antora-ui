This project produces a UI bundle that can be used by {url-antora}[Antora] to generate a documentation site.
You can see a preview of the UI at {url-preview}.

== Usage

If you want to simply use the UI for your Antora-generated site, add the following UI configuration to your playbook:

[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/feelpp/antora-ui/releases/download/v0.7/ui-bundle.zip
----

NOTE: Update the version in the download URL. Here, we are using version `v0.7`.

== Development Quickstart

This section offers a basic tutorial to teach you how to set up the default UI project, preview it locally, and bundle it for use with Antora.

=== Prerequisites

To preview and bundle the default UI, you need the following software on your computer:

* {url-git}[git] (command: `git`)
* {url-nodejs}[Node.js] (commands: `node` and `npm`)

==== git

First, make sure you have git installed.

 $ git --version

If not, {url-git-dl}[download and install] the git package for your system.

==== Node.js

Next, make sure that you have Node.js installed (which also provides npm).

 $ node --version

If this command fails with an error, you don't have Node.js installed.
If the command doesn't report an LTS version of Node.js (e.g., v10.15.3), it means you don't have a suitable version of Node.js installed.
In this guide, we'll be installing Node.js 10.

While you can install Node.js from the official packages, we strongly recommend that you use {url-nvm}[nvm] (Node Version Manager) to manage your Node.js installation(s).
Follow the {url-nvm-install}[nvm installation instructions] to set up nvm on your machine.

Once you've installed nvm, open a new terminal and install Node.js 16 using the following command:

 $ nvm install 16

You can switch to this version of Node.js at any time using the following command:

 $ nvm use 16

To make Node.js 16 the default in new terminals, type:

 $ nvm alias default 16

=== Clone and Initialize the UI Project

Clone the default UI project using git:

[subs=attributes+]
 $ git clone git@github.com:feelpp/antora-ui.git &&
   cd "`basename $_`"

The example above clones the project and then switches to the project folder on your filesystem.
Stay in this project folder when executing all subsequent commands.

Use npm to install the project's dependencies inside the project.
In your terminal, execute the following command:

 $ npm install

This command installs the dependencies listed in [.path]_package.json_ into the [.path]_node_modules/_ folder inside the project.
This folder does not get included in the UI bundle and should _not_ be committed to the source control repository.

=== Preview the UI

The project is configured to preview offline.
The files in the [.path]_preview-src/_ folder provide the sample content that allow you to see the UI in action.
In this folder, you'll primarily find pages written in AsciiDoc.
These pages provide a representative sample and kitchen sink of content from the real site.

To build the UI and preview it in a local web server, run the `start` command:

 $ npm start

You'll see a URL listed in the output of this command:

....
[12:00:00] Starting server...
[12:00:00] Server started http://localhost:5252
[12:00:00] Running server
....

Navigate to this URL to preview the site locally.

While this command is running, any changes you make to the source files will be instantly reflected in the browser.

Press kbd:[Ctrl+C] to stop the preview server and end the continuous build.

=== Package for Use with Antora

If you need to package the UI, so you can use it to generate the documentation site locally, run the following command:

 $ npm run build

If any errors are reported by lint, you'll need to fix them.

When the command completes successfully, the UI bundle will be available at [.path]_build/ui-bundle.zip_.
You can point Antora at this bundle using the `--ui-bundle-url` command-line option.

==== Source Maps

The build consolidates all the CSS and client-side JavaScript into combined files, [.path]_site.css_ and [.path]_site.js_, respectively, in order to reduce the size of the bundle.
{url-source-maps}[Source maps] correlate these combined files with their original sources.

This "`source mapping`" is accomplished by generating additional map files that make this association.
These map files sit adjacent to the combined files in the build folder.
The mapping they provide allows the debugger to present the original source rather than the obfuscated file, an essential tool for debugging.

In preview mode, source maps are enabled automatically, so there's nothing you have to do to make use of them.
If you need to include source maps in the bundle, you can do so by setting the `SOURCEMAPS` environment variable to `true` when you run the bundle command:

 $ SOURCEMAPS=true npm run build

In this case, the bundle will include the source maps, which can be used for debugging your production site.
